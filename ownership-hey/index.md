# HEY for Work Ownership & Administration Policy

HEY for Work accounts are owned by the organization detailed during signup, if this is a legal entity. If the organization is unincorporated, the account is owned by the individual who signed up for the account.

Regardless of ownership, the *administration* of the account is done by the Account Administrator. The person who originally signed up for the account is default designated the Account Administrator, but the role can be reassigned.

## What can the Account Administrator do?

The Account Administrator can:

* **Access and export all data in an account:** that means they have the ability to read every email sent or received within the HEY for Work account.
* **Manage all aspects of the account’s subscription:** including updating billing information, adding more users, and cancelling an account.
* **Configure and manage all technical aspects of an account's setup:** including verifying domain ownership and DNS-related records.
* **Request a change to reassign the account administratorship:** by [emailing us](mailto:support@hey.com) with the request.

## How can we change the Account Administrator?

If the account is owned by a legal entity, we can reassign account administratorship if provided with enough proof that the request is coming from a top-level organizational leader. To start a request to change the Account Administrator, an owner or chief executive of the organization must [email our support team](mailto:support@hey.com).

From there, we'll ask for more verification of identity and relationship to the organization as well as ensure that there are no pending disputes of ownership. This process will likely take several days, as we need to make absolutely sure the request is legitimate.

If we're unable to verify the legitimacy of the request, or if it's being disputed by the current Account Administrator, we may require a properly served court order for Basecamp LLC to proceed.

## Still have a question?

Please get in touch with our [support team](mailto:support@hey.com) and we’ll be happy to answer them!
