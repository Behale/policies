# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: September 16, 2019*

We hope that you love your Basecamp product but if you decide you no longer need it, we believe it should be easy for you to cancel your subscription. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve made it easy for you to cancel directly via each application, no questions asked.

Account owners can follow these instructions to cancel in-app:

## What happens when you cancel?

Cancellations are effective immediately, which means you will not be able to access your account after confirming the cancellation. If you want to save any content from your account, make sure to download them before canceling. Within 30 days, we permanently delete all content from our active systems and logs. Within 60 days, that content will also be permanently deleted from our backups. The data in backups are sparingly accessible, typically retrieved only for legal preservation requests. **Data can not be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

If you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up month, you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate any unused time in the last billing cycle but if you have not used your account in a while, please do reach out to Support for a [fair refund][https://basecamp.com/about/policies/refund].

## Basecamp-initiated cancellations

In an effort to keep both your and our digital footprints smaller, Basecamp may auto-cancel your account if it has been inactive for an extended period:
* For trial accounts: 30 days after a trial has expired without being upgraded
* For frozen, previously paid accounts: 180 days after being frozen due to billing failures
* For free accounts: after 365 days of inactivity

Finally, per our [Terms of Service][https://basecamp.com/about/policies/terms], Basecamp does have the right to suspend or terminate your account for any reason at any time. In practice, this means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are engaging in illegal behavior with our products such as spamming.
