## What’s the Chicago Lease Tax?  

A Lease Tax is like a sales tax, but instead of applying to items you purchase like clothes and electronics, the Lease Tax applies to your use of software that is accessed through cloud services.

## Do I have to pay this tax?

All City of Chicago customers are required to pay this tax. 

## How did Basecamp decide if I am a City of Chicago customer?

We used Chicago-area billing <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Chicago-Zip-Code-and-Neighborhood-Map/mapn-ahfc">zip codes</a> to determine who should be charged the tax.

## How does Basecamp calculate this tax?

Basecamp is using the City of Chicago required rate of 5.25% to calculate the tax. So, if your invoice is for $79, the tax is ($79&nbsp;×&nbsp;.0525) or $4.15. So the total due is ($79&nbsp;+&nbsp;4.15) or $83.15.
