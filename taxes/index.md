# Taxes!
If your billing address is in Ohio, Washington State, or the City of Chicago, you'll have to pay a tax when you pay for Basecamp. Here's why.

Some state or local governments impose taxes on Internet-based software, and Basecamp complies by collecting taxes on their behalf. The exact amount you're taxed depends on the rates determined by your local government. 100% of the taxes we collect are remitted to the taxing authority.
