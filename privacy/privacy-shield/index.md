# Basecamp EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.

This policy applies to personal data from the European Union and from Switzerland that is collected, used, and retained by us in the United States.

## Identity & Access
When you sign up for Basecamp, we ask for your name, company name, and email address. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission, either.

You always have the right to access the personal information we store about you. And, if you wish to further limit our use of your personal information, please contact Jeremy Daer at privacyshield@basecamp.com.

Users of Basecamp can store any type of information in Basecamp, but Basecamp does not access or share that data, and does not know what type of data you or other users are storing. The data is only used by the account owner and invited users as they intend to use it.

When you write Basecamp with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages, we'll track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info:

  * To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.
  * To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service](/about/policies/terms), or as otherwise required by law.
  * If Basecamp is acquired by or merged with another company—we don’t plan on that, but if it happens—we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Basecamp does not share individual’s personal data with non-agent third parties.  If this policy changes in the future, we will notify individuals and provide them with an opportunity to opt-out of having their data shared.

## Law Enforcement
While we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, Basecamp won’t otherwise hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject such other requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Encryption
All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data isn’t encrypted while it's live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest—you can read more about that on our [security page](/about/policies/security).

## Cookies
In order to improve our services and the website, and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to you, we and our vendors may use "cookies", "web beacons", and similar devices to track your activities.

## Third Parties
You understand that Basecamp uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide you with our services. A current list of vendors is available upon request.

In cases of onward transfer to these third parties for data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Basecamp is potentially liable should any issues or concerns arise.

## Deleted Data
When you cancel your account, we'll ensure that nothing is stored on our servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be purged within 30 days (up until then it's available in the trash can).

## EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework
Basecamp complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Basecamp has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.

Basecamp is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regard to the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
