# Notification of Copyright Infringement Claims

Making original work is hard! As described in our [Use Restrictions policy](abuse/index.md), you can’t use Basecamp products* to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html).

Are you a copyright owner? Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), you have the right to notify us (Basecamp, LLC) if you believe that an account user of any product we built and maintain has infringed on your work(s) as copyright owner. You can notify us through any of the following channels:

**By email**: [report@basecamp.com](mailto:report@basecamp.com)

**By mail**: Basecamp, LLC
30 North Racine Avenue, Suite 200
ATTN: David H. Hansson
Chicago, Illinois 60607

To be effective, the notification of claimed infringement must be written. Please include the following information:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- Identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed. If there are multiple, please share a representative list of those works.
- A way for us to locate the material you believe is infringing the copyrighted work.
- Contact information so that we can get back to you. Email address is preferred but a telephone number or mailing address works too.
- A statement that you, in good faith, belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**This policy and process applies to any product created and owned by Basecamp, LLC. That includes Basecamp (any version), HEY, Highrise, Campfire, Backpack, Writeboard, and Ta-da List.*
